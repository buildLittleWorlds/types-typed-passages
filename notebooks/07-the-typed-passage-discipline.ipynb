    "\n",
    "In this course, we learned Brennis Mund's **Typed Passage Discipline**:\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem\n",
    "- Omega and other non-terminating expressions threaten Archive stability\n",
    "- Kelleth Mund discovered the problem but couldn't solve it\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution\n",
    "- **Types as boundaries**: Passages declare what they accept\n",
    "- **Base types** (nat, bool) and **arrow types** (τ₁ → τ₂)\n",
    "- **Typing judgment** Γ ⊢ M : τ with three rules (VAR, ABS, APP)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Guarantees\n",
    "- **Preservation**: Types are preserved during reduction\n",
    "- **Progress**: Well-typed terms don't get stuck\n",
    "- **Strong Normalization**: Every well-typed term terminates\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Tradeoffs\n",
    "- Lost polymorphism (identity must be specialized)\n",
    "- Lost general recursion (Y combinator forbidden)\n",
    "- Recovered via primitive recursion\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Legacy\n",
    "Brennis gave passages their boundaries. Within those boundaries, the Archive is safe.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write out the complete typing derivation for composition: $\\lambda f.\\lambda g.\\lambda x.(f\\ (g\\ x))$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Classify these expressions as typable/untypable, terminating/non-terminating:\n",
    "   - $(\\lambda x.x)(\\lambda y.y)$\n",
    "   - $(\\lambda x.x\\ x)(\\lambda y.y\\ y)$\n",
    "   - $\\lambda f.(f\\ (f\\ (f\\ x)))$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Explain in your own words why types prevent Omega.\n",
